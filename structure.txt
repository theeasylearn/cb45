introduction to structure
-------------------------------
structure is special type of user defined datatype. structure is used to create special type of variable which has other variables of built in type or user defined type. 
it is basically used to group related variable together. 
first we have to create structure using  struct keyword then only we can create variable of structure type. 
how to declare structure?
struct structure-name {
    //create variables 
    datatype name;
    datatype name;
    .............
};

struct student 
{
    char name[32];
    int age;
    float weight;
    char gender;
};
variable declared inside structure is called member variable.

how to declare structure type variable
struct structure-name variable-name;
struct student s1;

how to take input inside structure member?
scanf("%d",&s1.age);
scanf("%f",&s1.weight);
gets(s1.name);
scanf("%c",&s1.gender);

how to display structure member?
printf("%d",s1.age);
printf("%f",s1.weight);
printf("%c",s1.gender);
puts(s1.name);

we can create array of structure. and we can also create array in structure.
