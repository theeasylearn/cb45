What are the decision making statements in c?
-----------------------------------------------
sometimes we need to execute few line of code conditionally. in such case we need to use decision making statements. it means execution of code depends on upon condition(relational expression). if condition is true then code block will execute otherwise not. there are many different types of decision making statements in c language 

    1) simple if decision making statements
    2) if else decision making statements
    3) if else if ladder decision making statements
    4) nested decision making statements
    5) switch decision making statements

1) simple if decision making statements
    here we check some condition (relational expression). if condition is true then only code block given inside {} pair will execute. 
    syntax 
    -------------------------------------------------
        if (relational expression)
        {

        }
