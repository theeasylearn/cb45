looping statement
------------------------------------------
in program, there may situations where we need to repeat block of code multiple times. in such case we might use loop. loop has two part 
    1) condition 
    2) block of code(which execute many times)

loop has condition. condition means relational expression if it is evaluated as true then block of code will be executed once. then condition is automatically checked again, if true again block of code will execute. this process will continue until condition is evaluated as false. 

there are 2 types of loop 
    1) entry control loop 
        while loop 
        for loop 
    2) exit control loop
        do while loop 

1) while loop 
    in while loop we check condition after while keyword. if condition is true then code block given inside { } pair will execute once. then again condition is checked if true code block given {} execute again. this will continue until condition is false. 

    syntax
    -------------------------------
    while (condition)
    {
        // code block will execute if condition is true 
    }

2) for loop 
----------------------------------------------
like while loop, for loop is also entry control loop. means here also condition is checked before loop execute, if condition is true code block given {} pair will execute. but for loop is different from while loop in way that, we give initial value to variable, condition and increment/decrement in single line. 
syntax
for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement)
{

}
1st time, initialization is done and then condition is checked
2nd time onwards, 1st increment/decrement happens and then condition is checked
example
for(;;)
{
    //code 
}
